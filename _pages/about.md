A Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.princeton.edu), [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu) working on network security and privacy. I am advised by Professor [Prateek Mittal](https://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/). I am particularly interested in the intersection of QUIC with security and privacy. My work has been recognized by the [Andreas Pfitzmann Best Student Paper Award](https://www.petsymposium.org/student-paper-award.php). For the first two years of my graduate studies, I was supported by the Global Korea Scholarship for Study Abroad.

I received my Bachelor's degree from the [College of Liberal Studies](https://www.cls.snu.ac.kr/en), [Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr) where I majored in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.snu.ac.kr/en) and Mathematical Sciences. I wrote senior theses for each major advised by Professors [Wan Choi](http://wcisl.snu.ac.kr/professor.php) (ECE) and [Myungjoo Kang](https://ncia.snu.ac.kr/general-5-1) (Math). I also worked with Professors [Hyungbo Shim](https://hshim.wordpress.com) (ECE) and [Seongcheol Kim](http://maxwell.snu.ac.kr/xe/professor) (ECE) as an undergraduate intern. The interdisciplinary nature of the College of Liberal Studies also led me to work on an independent research project on analyzing facial expressions in Korean election posters with Professor [Yunkyu Sohn](https://sociology.snu.ac.kr/en/snu__professor/sohn-yunkyu/) (Sociology).

Outside of research, I am a Student Ambassador for [Princeton University Concerts](https://concerts.princeton.edu) and an active participant of a wide variety of events on/around campus.
